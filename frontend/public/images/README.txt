Place your school photos in these folders:

1. /images/gallery/
   - Add school photos here (campus, classrooms, events, sports, etc.)
   - Name them like: campus-1.jpg, classroom-1.jpg, event-1.jpg, sports-1.jpg
   - Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp
   - Recommended size: At least 800x600 pixels

2. /images/faculty/
   - Add teacher photos here
   - Name them like: principal.jpg, teacher-1.jpg, teacher-2.jpg
   - Recommended size: 400x400 pixels (square)

3. /images/activities/
   - Add activity/event photos here
   - Name them like: sports-day.jpg, republic-day.jpg, science-fair.jpg

4. /images/
   - school-logo.png  (your school logo)
   - school-building.jpg  (main school building photo)

NOTE: Until you add real images, the website will show
placeholder images from picsum.photos (random stock photos).
Once you add your real photos, they will automatically be used.
